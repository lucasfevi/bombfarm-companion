`AppShell` grows into a sidebar nav + content area + status bar (data-driven `items`, controlled `activeId`/`onNavigate`; an empty/omitted `items` renders no nav rail). Adds `StatusChip`, the single implementation of the game-connection states (connected / not running / stale, with an optional age label), and `EmptyState` for "no game / no items / no filter matches" placeholders. The sidebar collapses to icons-only below the `compact` breakpoint; collapsed labels stay in the accessibility tree.

The desktop renderer adopts all three: its hand-rolled `formatStatus`/`statusClass` helpers and hardcoded `emerald`/`amber`/`--bf-*` classes are gone in favor of `StatusChip` and token-based chrome, and the "preload bridge unavailable" / "no snapshot yet" states now render through `EmptyState`.
