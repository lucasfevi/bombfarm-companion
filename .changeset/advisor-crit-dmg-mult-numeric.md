Read `crit_dmg_mult` as the persisted numeric in the advisor pipeline instead of re-deriving `treeGlassCannon ? 2 : 1`. `detectGlassCannon` flags the keystone for any value at or above 1.5, so a save carrying anything other than exactly 2 previously showed different crit damage depending on which code path rendered it.
