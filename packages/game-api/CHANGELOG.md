# @bombfarm/game-api

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- e55ebda: Add a consented, read-only reader for the account state the game's own server holds — roster,
  skills, casa, bag, gold and phase — replacing the plan for a memory-assembled account after a
  live calibration capture proved the game only loads that data on demand (a silently absent
  skill tree is not an empty tree; it is wrong advice computed from a zeroed one).

  **This is the first release in which the desktop contacts a network host on the player's
  behalf.** It happens only after the player explicitly accepts a first-run modal that states
  plainly what is used (the session token the game itself already saves locally), where it goes
  (`api.bombfarm.net` and nowhere else), that access is read-only, that no disruptive action is
  ever taken without approval, and that the decision is reversible at any time. Declining leaves
  the app fully usable on whatever account data was already stored.

  `@bombfarm/game-api` is a new package: a GET-only client (no write route exists anywhere in it,
  enforced by a guard test) built from a consent reducer, a token type that cannot be printed,
  serialised, or logged by any call site that forgets to redact it, a single-flight paced request
  path with a bounded cooldown backoff, the five account routes with committed response
  fingerprints that catch a game update before it is silently misread, and an assembler that
  turns one cycle's reads into a per-section fidelity report with no carry-over of its own.

  `@bombfarm/contracts` gains a fourth `SectionStatus`, `degraded` — the source answered, but its
  shape is no longer one this app parses safely, so it carries no body rather than a plausible
  wrong number — plus the `consent:get`/`accept`/`decline`/`revoke` IPC channels and the
  `consent:changed`/`account:changed` events.

  `@bombfarm/desktop` gains the platform edge that makes this real: the one `https` socket, the
  gated read of the token file, consent persisted alongside the existing account database, and
  the cycle that ties them to the account store's own last-known-good carry-over — a route that
  fails this cycle is served back from storage, honestly labelled stale, never silently dropped.
  Memory continues to serve combat telemetry only; the account state it can no longer be trusted
  to assemble is not looked to as a fallback, in this feature or ever.

  `@bombfarm/domain` gains a test file and committed fixtures proving the assembled payload
  parses through its unmodified parser (`packages/domain/src` is untouched) — a `patch`, since
  `changeset status` treats any change under a package's directory as package-changed regardless
  of whether it touched `src` or `tests`, and `updateInternalDependencies: patch` would apply this
  bump automatically the moment its `@bombfarm/contracts` dependency moves regardless.

  No web planner behaviour changes.
