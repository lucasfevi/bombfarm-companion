## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 06bcc05: Removes `InventoryItem.iconUrl` and the parser that built it.

  The inventory parser composed a live wiki asset URL from the item's _instance_ level and handed it
  back on every parsed item. Nothing rendered that field — item art comes from the bundled assets via
  `itemIconSrc`, which keys off the set's native level — so the URL was both unused and wrong. Item
  art must never be sourced from the wire, so the builder and the contract field are gone rather than
  corrected.

  No consumer migration: the field had no readers.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 1fa3def: **The desktop's advice now updates by itself.** When a poll shows a hero's gear, level, stars,
  abilities or the skill tree changed, the on-screen advice recomputes and updates within one
  refresh cycle — no restart, no re-navigation, no manual refresh button. When nothing
  planning-relevant changed, the advice does **not** recompute: a scripted sequence (identical,
  relevant change, irrelevant change, identical) asserts the recompute counter moves exactly `1, 2,
2, 2`, the spec's own Independent Test verbatim.

  `account:changed` now fires only when the account genuinely changed, not on every poll cycle. A
  new pure export, `accountChangeKey(payload: AccountPayload): string` (`@bombfarm/contracts`,
  zero new dependencies), is the one canonical, `capturedAt`-blind change key both the main process
  (gating the `account:changed` emit) and the renderer (gating which pushed/fetched view is
  accepted) compare against. A second, exact key — `heroChangeKey`/`sharedChangeKey`
  (`apps/desktop/renderer/lib/planning/hero-advice.ts`) — decides which heroes actually recompute:
  a one-hero gear change recomputes that hero only; a shared-tree change recomputes every hero,
  correctly.

  A section leaving `resolved` (`stale`/`missing`/`degraded`) withdraws its dependent numbers in the
  same render as the status change, never one cycle behind; a section returning to `resolved`
  recomputes from the new data, never from a pre-degradation cache.

  The full 11-hero recompute completes in ~1 ms (measured), asserted against a 16 ms budget — one
  60 Hz frame, the threshold below which the recompute cannot delay the Electron main event loop or
  drop a renderer frame.

  **No behaviour change for the web planner.** `apps/web` is untouched — zero files changed, source
  and tests alike. `packages/ui` and `packages/domain` are untouched too: the recompute stays in the
  renderer, memoised: only the change _decision_ moved to main, and no worker was introduced in
  either process.

- e78122a: **The desktop now speaks English and Brazilian Portuguese throughout.** It defaults from the
  system language (every Portuguese OS locale variant — `pt-PT`, `pt-AO`, bare `pt` — resolves to
  the one Portuguese translation that exists), is switchable at any time from a new Settings tab,
  and the choice is remembered across restarts. Every screen — navigation, status chrome, planning
  views, fidelity messages, empty states, errors — renders from one typed, compile-time-checked
  string source per language; a key present in only one language fails the build rather than
  shipping a half-translated screen.

  Game terms (hero rarity today; ability/house/slot/set names as the shell grows to render them)
  follow the chosen language through `@bombfarm/domain`'s existing `game-labels.ts` helpers — the
  underlying stored key is unchanged, localisation is display-layer only. Numbers and relative-age
  text follow the locale too: DPS and counts group thousands the PT-BR way (`1.234` vs `1,234`), and
  next-point gains sign and format per locale (`+1,5%` vs `+1.5%`).

  A language switch is a display change, never an account change — it triggers no refresh and no
  advice recompute, proved both structurally (the locale cannot enter any change key) and by a
  compute-count assertion. If the chosen language cannot be saved (a read-only save location), the
  language still applies for the session and the failure is surfaced, rather than silently
  reverting on the next launch.

  `packages/contracts` gains `AppLocale`, `DOMAIN_LANG_BY_LOCALE`, `BCP47_BY_LOCALE`,
  `resolveStartupLocale` and two verb-shaped settings channels — the one place the desktop's locale
  token maps to the domain's language and to `Intl`'s BCP-47 tags; the existing `contextBridge` is
  unchanged (zero-argument channels, following the shipped consent quartet's shape).

  **No behaviour change for the web planner.** `apps/web` is untouched — zero files changed, source
  and tests alike — and its own `Lang`/`bf_lang`/`pt` default and namespace files are unaffected.
  `packages/ui` and `packages/domain` are untouched too: four English `aria-label`s inside
  `packages/ui` (`AppShell`'s nav landmark, `Num`'s increment/decrement) and the `ConsentModal`'s
  legal disclosure stay English by design — `packages/ui` may not change, and the consent text's
  `textVersion` means a translated rendering could constitute wording the player never agreed to.
  Both are pinned, named exceptions, not oversights.

- 453ed05: **The drift guard can now see the change it was built to catch.** The 2026-08-13 game patch
  reshaped `skills.totals` and the mechanism meant to notice — `fingerprints.ts` — ran on every CI
  job and passed, because it only checked top-level key presence and never treated an added key as
  a failure. This change deepens the guard and uses it to reject stale data on both surfaces.

  **Deepened fingerprint (`@bombfarm/domain`, `@bombfarm/game-api`):** the schema check now descends
  into declared nested paths (`skills.totals`, `heroes[]`, `items[]`, `casa`, `account`) instead of
  only the top level, and an **added** key is now fatal at every declared level, not only a missing
  one. The five API route bodies and the save-export file's own shape are fingerprinted from one
  shared key catalogue. `RouteFingerprint.requiredKeys` (a flat, subset-checked list) is gone;
  `checkShape` no longer has an `{ ok: true, unknownKeys }` branch.

  **New rejection reason (`@bombfarm/domain`, `@bombfarm/web`):** importing a save file now checks
  for the presence of the patch's new keys (`skills.refunds`, `skills.totals.vagas_campo`,
  `skills.totals.bag_tabs_bonus`) before parsing. A save missing them — pre-patch or truncated — is
  rejected with a new generic message, in EN and PT-BR, that names no keystone, version, date or
  field path so it stays accurate after the next patch. The specific missing keys are still recorded
  in `ParseResult.warnings` for diagnosis.

  **Two drop rules, never a migration (`@bombfarm/web`, `@bombfarm/desktop`):** a locally stored
  planner account on the web, or a stored SQLite account section on desktop, that still carries a
  retired keystone field (or fails its own fingerprint) is dropped and deleted rather than served or
  patched up. Clean stored data is left byte-unchanged. Neither surface gains a new upload affordance.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 84c8c15: Add per-section account persistence so the desktop remembers an account across restarts.

  `@bombfarm/contracts` gains the stored-account serving contract: `StoredSectionFidelity` (a
  narrowed union that structurally cannot represent `resolved`), `StoredAccountFidelity`,
  `AccountStoreStatus`, `AccountStoreReason`, `RestoredAccount` (`gameRunning` is the literal
  `false`), and `AccountView` — plus a new `account:get` IPC channel returning `AccountView`.

  `@bombfarm/desktop`'s `Storage` wrapper gains a real per-section SQLite store
  (`apps/desktop/src/main/storage/**`): each of the five account sections (`account`, `heroes`,
  `skills`, `casa`, `items`) persists independently with its own `capturedAt`, so a poll that
  resolves the roster but misses skills keeps the previous skills row untouched rather than
  blanking it. Writes run in one transaction per poll and only ever touch sections a payload
  marks `resolved`, so a partial read can never blank stored data. When the desktop starts with
  the game closed, the account it shows is read-only, honestly stamped with its capture time, and
  `gameRunning` is explicit — no code path can serve a stored section as `resolved`, enforced by
  the type (a compile error), the schema (no status column — status is derived from row
  presence), and a source guard.

  A pre-existing `last-snapshot.json` from an earlier install is imported once, then the file is
  never written again; the desktop's previous JSON-file persistence mechanism (`SnapshotStore`)
  is removed along with a bug it carried — a cold boot with the game closed no longer reports the
  previous session's `connected` status read from disk.

  No web planner behaviour changes.

- 66d38d0: Add a source-neutral account payload contract and route save-file parsing through it.

  `@bombfarm/contracts` gains `AccountPayload` plus its per-section fidelity types
  (`AccountSection`, `SectionStatus`, `SectionFidelity`, `AccountFidelity`, `AccountFidelityGrade`,
  `AccountFidelityReport`) — the typed shape both the web upload path and the future desktop
  live-memory reader (MP2 F2) will target. It declares no `export_version` / `generated_at`; those
  stay file-only.

  `@bombfarm/domain`'s `parseSaveFile` is now a five-line file adapter over a new exported entry
  point, `parseAccountPayload(payload, existing)`, which takes the typed payload directly instead
  of a raw file object. The ~250-line parsing body itself did not move, change, or reorder — only
  the wrapping changed. A new `deriveAccountFidelity` (with the `ACCOUNT_SECTIONS` constant) turns
  a per-section fidelity block into one overall grade (`full` / `degraded` / `unavailable`) plus the
  list of degraded sections; it is pure, with no I/O.

  No behaviour change for the web planner: `parseSaveFile`'s name, signature, and exact output
  (including warning strings and their order) are unchanged, proven by a digest against the
  pre-refactor result on the canonical fixtures, and by all 74 existing `apps/web` import tests
  passing byte-unchanged. `@bombfarm/web` is not listed above — it picks up an automatic patch
  from the `@bombfarm/domain` dependency bump, but nothing a planner user can observe changed.

- e55ebda: Add a consented, read-only reader for the account state the game's own server holds — roster,
  skills, casa, bag, gold and phase — replacing the plan for a memory-assembled account after a
  live calibration capture proved the game only loads that data on demand (a silently absent
  skill tree is not an empty tree; it is wrong advice computed from a zeroed one).

  **This is the first release in which the desktop contacts a network host on the player's
  behalf.** It happens only after the player explicitly accepts a first-run modal that states
  plainly what is used (the session token the game itself already saves locally), where it goes
  (`api.bombfarm.net` and nowhere else), that access is read-only, that no disruptive action is
  ever taken without approval, and that the decision is reversible at any time. Declining leaves
  the app fully usable on whatever account data was already stored.

  `@bombfarm/game-api` is a new package: a GET-only client (no write route exists anywhere in it,
  enforced by a guard test) built from a consent reducer, a token type that cannot be printed,
  serialised, or logged by any call site that forgets to redact it, a single-flight paced request
  path with a bounded cooldown backoff, the five account routes with committed response
  fingerprints that catch a game update before it is silently misread, and an assembler that
  turns one cycle's reads into a per-section fidelity report with no carry-over of its own.

  `@bombfarm/contracts` gains a fourth `SectionStatus`, `degraded` — the source answered, but its
  shape is no longer one this app parses safely, so it carries no body rather than a plausible
  wrong number — plus the `consent:get`/`accept`/`decline`/`revoke` IPC channels and the
  `consent:changed`/`account:changed` events.

  `@bombfarm/desktop` gains the platform edge that makes this real: the one `https` socket, the
  gated read of the token file, consent persisted alongside the existing account database, and
  the cycle that ties them to the account store's own last-known-good carry-over — a route that
  fails this cycle is served back from storage, honestly labelled stale, never silently dropped.
  Memory continues to serve combat telemetry only; the account state it can no longer be trusted
  to assemble is not looked to as a fallback, in this feature or ever.

  `@bombfarm/domain` gains a test file and committed fixtures proving the assembled payload
  parses through its unmodified parser (`packages/domain/src` is untouched) — a `patch`, since
  `changeset status` treats any change under a package's directory as package-changed regardless
  of whether it touched `src` or `tests`, and `updateInternalDependencies: patch` would apply this
  bump automatically the moment its `@bombfarm/contracts` dependency moves regardless.

  No web planner behaviour changes.
